worldwind-vr
============

This repository houses a modification to NASA worldwind with Virtual Reality capabilities.

Though the application is actually sort of usably cool as of 8-25-2013, it is currently in 
a very rough stage of development, this README will be updated with instructions for running 
it when it is ready.

If you are insistent on playing with it now, simply run the WorldWindVRTest.launch configuration.

Thanks are due to the following people:

 - 38leinaD for his JRift project as well as the original LWJGL shader (which we adapted for JOGL
   and without which we would have been hopelessly lost, as we had no prior 3D graphics experience)
 - The Minecrift guys (mabrowning et. al) for updating JRift to work with the latest Rift SDK
 - NASA and its WorldWind development team
 - Palmer and everyone at Oculus VR for this amazing device and toolkit
